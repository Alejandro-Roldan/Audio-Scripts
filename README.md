# Audio-Scripts
Multiple audio related (directly or inderectly) scripts.

A lot of my programming consist in trying to have a better musical experience. Either with scripting or program configurations or full fledge programs. And it can affect any part of the process (getting the music, having the proper classification and metadata, how you experience it, hardware, software...)

And so i decided to compile not all but almost all the the relevant files here.

## pavucontrol.sh
A script to easily volume control pulseaudio. It dinamically uses the active sink, can raise and lower the volume, set a defined value, mute, unmute and toggle.
